[![Portal](https://img.shields.io/gradle-plugin-portal/v/org.cthing.cthing-publishing?label=Plugin%20Portal&logo=gradle)](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/org.cthing.cthing-publishing)

A Gradle plugin that provides support for the publishing of C Thing Software artifacts. This plugin
is applicable only to C Thing Software projects.

## Usage

The plugin is available from the
[Gradle Plugin Portal](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/org.cthing.cthing-publishing) and can be
applied to a Gradle project using the `plugins` block:

```kotlin
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
}

plugins {
  id("org.cthing.cthing-publishing") version "2.0.0"
}
```

The plugin creates two extensions, `cthingPublishing` and `cthingRepo`. The `cthingPublishing`
extension provides methods for obtaining the direct dependencies on C Thing Software artifacts
and create an action to populate the POM fields with C Thing Software publishing information.
The `cthingRepo` extension provides information about the C Thing Software artifact repository.

The following is an example of a typical usage of the `cthingPublishing` extension:
```kotlin
publishing {
    publications {
        register("jar", MavenPublication::class) {
            from(components["java"])

            pom(cthingPublishing.createPomAction())
        }
    }
}
```
The following is an example of a typical usage of the `cthingRepo` extension:
```kotlin
publishing {
    val repoUrl = cthingRepo.repoUrl
    if (repoUrl != null) {
        repositories {
            maven {
                name = "CThingMaven"
                setUrl(repoUrl)
                credentials {
                    username = cthingRepo.user
                    password = cthingRepo.password
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Compatibility

The following Gradle and Java versions are supported:

| Plugin Version | Gradle Version | Minimum Java Version |
